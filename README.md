#Analysis of satellite images of the Arctic Ocean.

Introduction
The data used in this problem set was/is collected by two different satellite missions. Involved are the AMSR-E instrument on the Aqua satellite (data from 2002 to 2011) and the AMSR2 instrument on the GCOM-W satellite (data from 2013 to 2019). The data consist of maps of the concentration of ice in the Arctic collected between 2002 and 2019 with the exception of 2012. This a small subset of the complete satellite data set, with only two ice maps every month (some are missing though), all the data were downloaded from here.

There is an ice-map for each first and each 15th of a month from the years 2003-2011 and 2013-2019. For instance, the file 20080415.npy represents data for the 15th of April 2008. The primary goal of this project is to utilize satellite images to check whether there has been a decrease in the concentration of ice in the Arctic Ocean in recent years.
